    <p class="maintxt">Achieve the perfect oven-roasted chips at home with 
        a fluffy interior and crispy skin. These are much 
        easier to cook and lower in fat than fried</p>
    
    <h2 class="subheader">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="maintxt">
        <li>6 large potatoes</li>
        <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp celery salt</li>
        <li>sea salt, to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="subheader">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="maintxt">
        <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Peel the 
            potatoes and cut them into long chip shapes – 
            the thickness is entirely up to you, though the 
            width of a finger is ideal. Rinse under the cold 
            tap and pat dry with a tea towel.</li>
        <li>Spread the chips on a large non-stick baking tray 
            and toss with the olive oil and celery salt. Lie 
            them flat in a single layer – use two trays 
            rather than overcrowd one.</li>
        <li>Roast for 45-50 mins, turning now and then. When 
            cooked they should be golden brown and crisp with 
            a light fluffy centre. Scatter on sea salt to serve.</li>
